Hello friends and welcome to this full day workshop on Azure Data Factory. Today we will be all becoming advanced factory workers!... And we completely recommend this description when describing your job to family members. But be warned, if you go on to tell them that the factory is in the cloud you are likely to be branded as crazy. However, here and now that is ok. You are amoungst like minded geeky friends that all want to become cloud factory workers as well :-)

On a more serious note; throughout our day of training you will quickly notice, like with most technologies, there is an awful lot of different ways you can implement this Azure orchestration service and understanding the best way to do something is often the biggest challenge. That said, if you only take away one thing from today I would ask that you have an appreciation of this fact. Then when delviering solutions you take a step back from the requirements and think about the overall technical design and how Azure Data Factory should fit into your platform as a core component.

All to often with new and shiny services we start playing around then try to make the technology fit our solution. Rather than thinking about the solution requirements and which technology meets our needs. This is true of all developers, I don't want to preach, so am simply asking for a little bit of mindfulness.

## Session Abstract

__A Day Full of Azure Data Factory__

If we want to achieve any data processing in Azure you need an umbrella service to manage, monitor and schedule your solution. For a long time when working on premises, the SQL Agent has been our go-to tool, combined with T-SQL and SSIS packages. It’s now time to upgrade our skills and start using cloud native services to achieve the same thing on the Microsoft Cloud Platform. Within a PaaS only Modern Data Platform, the primary component for delivering that orchestration is Azure Data Factory, combined with various other compute resources.

In this full day of training we’ll start with the basics and learn how to orchestration your Azure Data Platform end to end. You learn how to build our Azure ETL/ELT pipelines using all Data Factory has to offer. Plus, consider hybrid architectures, dynamic design patterns, think about lifting and shifting legacy packages, and explore complex bootstrapping to orchestrate everything within your solution.

We’ll breakdown the content for this rich Azure PaaS resource as follows:

* Azure Data Factory fundamentals. What is it and why use it?
* Uploading data from on-premises to Azure.
* Using SSIS packages in Azure.
* Data Factory Mapping & Wrangling Data Flows.
* Dynamic metadata driven pipelines.
* Data Factory alerting, security and monitoring.
* Pipeline pricing.
* Data Factory CI/CD using Azure DevOps.
* Using Azure Data Factory in production.

If that's not enough content for one day, you will also get access to a set of hands-on labs that you can work through at your own pace. Whether you are new to Azure Data Factory or have some experience, you will leave this workshop with new skills and ideas for your projects.
